# 05-Schedule
Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Moment.js.

Based on the time of the day, the time blocks will be color coded red for current, green for future and grey for in the past.
Type your event you would like to save using the save button and itll be saved to local storage. 
once saved you should be able to leave the page and return back to the page with the same event.
